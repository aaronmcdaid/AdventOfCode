[Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

In progress. At last update of this readme, the first two days were completed

How to run it:
```
cd 2021
python3.6 -m advent_of_code.runner day1a
```

Each day has two puzzles. Hence, 'day1a' above is the first puzzle on day1. Use 'day1b' for the second puzzle of day 1
